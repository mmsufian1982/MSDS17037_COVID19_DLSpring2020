# MSDS17037_COVID19_DLSpring2020

This repository contains code and results for COVID-19 classification assignment by Deep Learning Spring 2020 course offered at Information Technology University, Lahore, Pakistan. This assignment is only for learning purposes and is not intended to be used for clinical purposes.

## Background
New studies [1] have revealed that the damage done to lungs by infections belonging to the family of coronaviruses (COVID-19, SARS, ARDS etc.) can be observed in X-Ray and CT scan images. 
With a worldwide shortage of test kits, it is possible that careful analysis of X-Ray and CT scan images may be used in diagnosis of COVID-19 and for the regular assessment while they are recovering.
Neural Network Transfer Learning to classify COVID 19/Pneumonia vs Normal cases using X-Ray images.

## Implementation of VGG16 and ResNet18
VGG16 and ResNet18 pretrained Models have been acquired in Pytorch and using Transfer Learning, one or more layers of models are retrained to achieve the best possible accuracy.
